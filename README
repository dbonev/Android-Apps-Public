# This repository contains the source code for some of my Android apps.	#
# 									#
# I work (my day job) as a software developer (mainly .net) and 	#
# I write Android apps just for fun in my spare time.			#
#									#
# The apps are usually really small /a few activities + some helpers/	#
# so it should be pretty easy for anyone to understand them and play 	#
# with the code.							#
#									#
# So nothing really special or outstanding, but the code might be 	#
# useful for reference how to (or not to) do certain things in Android	#
