Please note that Maia was never intended to be Siri or some other 
form of 'intelligent' (ha-ha) assistant. 

Actually Maia was in the Android Market before Siri for iPhone 4S
was even announced by Apple.

The idea is that you configure some sequence of stories and then
Maia can play them in the order you've defined.

Example stories would be:

~Salutation ('Hello, Sir');
~The news from CNN;
~Your horoscope;
~News from Techmeme;
~A joke;

Maia's URL in the market is: 
https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bubblelake.maia

There are plenty of opportunities to extend the app so it 
could be more useful. I will be glad if someone is interested.
